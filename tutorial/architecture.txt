How this engine works is this:

The @ is an entity with a position, character, color, etc, this data is represented by components,
detailed in the global_entity_values.hpp file

the system in the system folder will loop over every entity specified and execute things based on
the modules in the system/modules folder to update and render them.

modules are the bread and butter of this engine and are the preferred way of adding features to the
game, with engine tools and other files being a support structure.
