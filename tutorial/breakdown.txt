As for how to break things down. it's not exactly clear most of the time as it depends a lot on a
case by case basis, but for something like a fireball spell that you can shoot at a bunch of enemies
and when it lands it lights a bunch of random tiles in a limited area on fire while also dealing
damage to enemies, you can break it down like this:

You can first use a raycast through the line drawing toolkit that comes with libtcod and a distance
calculating function to figure out the range of the spell, assuming you want to shoot it like a wand
and has a limited range.

Then you can implement the fireball projectile itself for an animation if you want, or if you only want
it to be raycast then you can skip the projectile step and go straight to the next one.

Finally for when the projectile lands, you can log the landing location, mark out an area affected by
the impact then iterate through the tiles in that area twice, the first iteration can be for
determining who gets damaged by flipping a coin every tile and you can roll a random number to see how
much they get damaged, the second will be for determining which tile is lit on fire.

The next step is to actually implement that, which sometimes can be rather straight forward, but other
times can also be rather troublesome. For that I recommend using google, stack overflow and especially
discord to contact people to get help on how to get that working.
