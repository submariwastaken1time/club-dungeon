this is an engine built with modularity in mind, every single part of the engine is built to be like
lego pieces where you can pretty much mix and match every piece arbitrarily as long as every piece
agrees with eachother

this is all of the code that is in my tutorial, but before you go through it, you should understand
what these terms i use mean:

modules: these are functions that do the logic of the game and are built to be modular, for example:
want movement removed from the game? remove the move.hpp file in the src/system/modules folder and
every place where move is called and nothing will move

engine_tools: these are utilities meant to do other miscellaneous things, like managing mapping info,
translating keys to an action dictionary, things like that

renderables: these are entities with position, icon and foreground color components

the rest of the terms are rather standard and or come from the entt library that i use as the main
backbone to this engine
